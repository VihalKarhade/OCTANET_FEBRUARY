# Task 1: Build a Landing Page using HTML and CSS
### A landing page is one of the best web development projects for beginners. A foundational understanding of HTML and CSS is required. You will learn how to add columns, divide sections, arrange items, add headers, footers. Create an impressive page using your creativity.
### It is important to pay attention to the alignment, the padding, the color palette, and boxes. Make sure CSS doesnâ€™t overlap elements.
